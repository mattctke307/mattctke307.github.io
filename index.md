## SNHU Computer Science Capstone Project
### Introduction

	Over the course of attending Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed myself into a computer science professional. Among the long list of knowledge and experience I have gained in the program, I want to start by pointing out that I did not have any programming knowledge nor could I code “Hello World” when I began my journey. I want to start with this tidbit to emphasize the wealth of knowledge I have gained while in the Computer Science program and the amount of research and learning that I am capable of in a short period of time.
	One of my main strengths is the ability to problem solve and find solutions to issues as they arise. I have had years of experience in researching and getting an answer, even when I don’t initially have one, to solve problems and provide satisfactory answers and outcomes in a business setting. These skills transition well into the world of computer science by giving me an edge in analytical thinking.
	Some of the main skills that I have learned during my degree are the software development lifecycle, good coding standards, and object-oriented programming. These best coding practices can be observed when looking at the initial code and the enhancements I have made in this class. One example would be breaking the code into multiple classes and using calls to bring the information into the main. 
  One way that I have used these artifacts to show my ability to explain my work to shareholders and programmers is the use of detailed comments in my code. These comments explain what each part of my program does and how it fits in to the whole application. My ability to explain the knowledge I have learned in my degree program into simpler terms allows me to prove I have a grasp on the concepts I have learned and also help others that do not have my programming background to understand the scope of a job and how requirements can be met.
  By using the three artifacts in this ePortfolio to provide a working example, I want to demonstrate my ability to design and engineer a program, use algorthims to enhance the security of my application and use a database to create a more inclusive way for people on my team to work with data in my program.
  

### Artifact 1

  The first artifact takes my initial code and breaks the code down into smaller classes. This was essential for me when it came time to test the program for errors. By seperating important components into smaller sections, I was able to pinpoint areas that were not working inside the program quickly and efficiently. Finding and fixing errors quickly plays an important role when working in the Software Development Lifecycle. Whether working in phases or using an Agile method of smaller sprints, quick error resolution also saves the company money in the long run. I had to narrow down the scope of my project in this artifact. I initially wanted to add a GUI to enhance the front-end look of my appliaction. Due to the quick turn of my class, I decided to focus on cleaning up the code and good coding standards.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mattctke307/mattctke307.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
