## SNHU Computer Science Capstone Project
### Introduction

Over the course of attending Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed the tools needed to become a successful computer science professional.  To start, I did not have any programming knowledge nor could I code “Hello World” when I began my journey. I want to start with this tidbit to emphasize the wealth of knowledge I have gained while in 
the Computer Science program and the amount of research and learning that I am capable of in a short period of time.
One of my main strengths is the ability to problem solve and find solutions to issues as they arise. I have had years of experience in researching and getting an answer,
even when I don’t initially have one, to solve problems and provide satisfactory answers and outcomes in a business setting. These skills transition well into the world of
computer science by giving me an edge in analytical thinking.
Some of the key skills that I have learned during my degree are the software development lifecycle, good coding standards, and object-oriented programming. These best
coding practices can be observed when looking at the initial code and the enhancements I have made in this class. One example would be breaking the code into multiple classes
and using calls to bring the information into the main. 
One way that I have used these artifacts to show my ability to explain my work to shareholders and programmers is the use of detailed comments in my code. These comments
explain what each part of my program does and how it fits in to the whole application. My ability to explain the knowledge I have learned in my degree program into simpler terms
allows me to prove I have a grasp on the concepts I have learned and also help others that do not have my programming background to understand the scope of a job and how
requirements can be met.
By using the three artifacts in this ePortfolio to provide a working example, I want to demonstrate my ability to design and engineer a program, use algorthims to
enhance the security of my application and use a database to create a more inclusive way for people on my team to work with data in my program.
  

### Artifact 1

The first artifact takes my initial code and breaks the code down into smaller classes. This was essential for me when it came time to test the program for errors. By seperating important components into smaller sections, I was able to pinpoint areas that were not working inside the program quickly and efficiently. Finding and fixing errors quickly plays an important role when working in the Software Development Lifecycle. Whether working in phases or using an Agile method of smaller sprints, quick error resolution also saves the company money in the long run. I had to narrow down the scope of my project in this artifact. I initially wanted to add a GUI to enhance the front-end look of my appliaction. Due to the quick turn of my class, I decided to focus on cleaning up the code and good coding standards to improve functionality in leiu of addressing aesthetics.
  
### Artifact 2

The second artifact enhances the orgininal by adding a layer of security to the application. As part of a security first mindset, the application is integrated wtih a MD5 hash to create a login to the program. The login uses a username and password that is generated into a hashmap. This hashmap provides a simple way to store the required username and check the password against an encrypted string to authenticate the user. In this addition to my program, the user has two select entries to login to the program. The login fucntion is created inside a loop that allows three attempts to enter the username and password to verify access before the program closes. This is to ensure a lockout device after the username and password attempts are failed too many times.

### Artifact 3

Throughout my coursework, I have worked in both MySQL and MongoDB to attach code to databases. In this instance, I chose to link a MySql database to the program. By using the services tab in NetBeans, I linked a database to the program through which I could modify user access information without the need of the command line interface. In a team setting, this would allow project managers to easily make changes without the knowledge of how the command line interace works in the databse.
